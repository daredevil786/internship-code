NumPy
Numpy introduction
The NumPy package (read as NUMerical PYthon) provides access to

a new data structure called arrays which allow

efficient vector and matrix operations. It also provides

a number of linear algebra operations (such as solving of systems of linear equations, computation of Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues).

History
Some background information: There are two other implementations that provide nearly the same functionality as NumPy. These are called “Numeric” and “numarray”:

Numeric was the first provision of a set of numerical methods (similar to Matlab) for Python. It evolved from a PhD project.

Numarray is a re-implementation of Numeric with certain improvements (but for our purposes both Numeric and Numarray behave virtually identical).

Early in 2006 it was decided to merge the best aspects of Numeric and Numarray into the Scientific Python (`scipy`) package and to provide (a hopefully “final”) array data type under the module name “NumPy”.

We will use in the following materials the “NumPy” package as provided by (new) SciPy. If for some reason this doesn’t work for you, chances are that your SciPy is too old. In that case, you will find that either “Numeric” or “numarray” is installed and should provide nearly the same capabilities.[5]

Arrays
We introduce a new data type (provided by NumPy) which is called “array”. An array appears to be very similar to a list but an array can keep only elements of the same type (whereas a list can mix different kinds of objects). This means arrays are more efficient to store (because we don’t need to store the type for every element). It also makes arrays the data structure of choice for numerical calculations where we often deal with vectors and matricies.

Vectors and matrices (and matrices with more than two indices) are all called “arrays” in NumPy.

Vectors (1d-arrays)
The data structure we will need most often is a vector. Here are a few examples of how we can generate one:

Array Creation and Properties
There are a lot of ways to create arrays. Let's look at a few

Here we create an array using arange and then change its shape to be 3 rows and 5 columns.

In [ ]:
import numpy as np
In [ ]:
a = np.arange(15)
b = np.arange(20)
In [ ]:
a
b
Out[ ]:
array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
       17, 18, 19])
In [ ]:
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3,5)

a
Out[ ]:
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])
A NumPy array has a lot of meta-data associated with it describing its shape, datatype, etc.

In [ ]:
print(a.ndim)
print(a.shape)
print(a.size)
print(a.dtype)
print(a.itemsize)
print(type(a))
2
(3, 5)
15
int64
8
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
In [ ]:
help(a)
we can create an array from a list

In [ ]:
b = np.array( [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] )
print(b)
print(b.dtype)
print(type(b))
[1. 2. 3. 4.]
float64
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
we can create a multi-dimensional array of a specified size initialized all to 0 easily. There is also an analogous ones() and empty() array routine. Note that here we explicitly set the datatype for the array.

Unlike lists in python, all of the elements of a numpy array are of the same datatype

In [ ]:
c = np.eye(10)
dtype=np.float64
c
linspace (and logspace) create arrays with evenly space (in log) numbers. For logspace, you specify the start and ending powers (base**start to base**stop)

In [ ]:
d = np.linspace(-1, 2, 15, endpoint=True)
print(d)
In [ ]:
e = np.logspace(-1, 2, 15, endpoint=True, base=10)
print(e)
As always, as for help -- the numpy functions have very nice docstrings

In [ ]:
help(np.logspace)
we can also initialize an array based on a function

In [ ]:
f = np.fromfunction(lambda i, j: i == j, (3, 3), dtype=int)
f
Array Operations
most operations (+, -, *, /) will work on an entire array at once, element-by-element.

Note that that the multiplication operator is not a matrix multiply (there is a new operator in python 3.5+, @, to do matrix multiplicaiton.

Let's create a simply array to start with

In [ ]:
a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
print(a)
[[ 0  1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6  7]
 [ 8  9 10 11]]
Multiplication by a scalar multiplies every element

In [ ]:
a*2
Out[ ]:
array([[ 0,  2,  4,  6],
       [ 8, 10, 12, 14],
       [16, 18, 20, 22]])
adding two arrays adds element-by-element

In [ ]:
a + a
Out[ ]:
array([[ 0,  2,  4,  6],
       [ 8, 10, 12, 14],
       [16, 18, 20, 22]])
multiplying two arrays multiplies element-by-element

In [ ]:
a*a
Out[ ]:
array([[  0,   1,   4,   9],
       [ 16,  25,  36,  49],
       [ 64,  81, 100, 121]])
We can think of our 2-d array a was a 3 x 5 matrix (3 rows, 5 columns). We can take the transpose to geta 5 x 3 matrix, and then we can do a matrix multiplication

In [ ]:
b = a.transpose()
b
Out[ ]:
array([[ 0,  4,  8],
       [ 1,  5,  9],
       [ 2,  6, 10],
       [ 3,  7, 11]])
In [ ]:
a @ b
Out[ ]:
array([[ 14,  38,  62],
       [ 38, 126, 214],
       [ 62, 214, 366]])
We can sum along axes or the entire array

In [ ]:
print(a)
a.sum(axis=1)
[[ 0  1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6  7]
 [ 8  9 10 11]]
Out[ ]:
array([ 6, 22, 38])
In [ ]:
a.sum()
Out[ ]:
66
Also get the extrema

In [ ]:
print(a.min(), a.max())
0 11
universal functions
Up until now, we have been discussing some of the basic nuts and bolts of NumPy; now, we will dive into the reasons that NumPy is so important in the Python data science world. Namely, it provides an easy and flexible interface to optimized computation with arrays of data.

Computation on NumPy arrays can be very fast, or it can be very slow. The key to making it fast is to use vectorized operations, generally implemented through NumPy's universal functions (ufuncs). This section motivates the need for NumPy's ufuncs, which can be used to make repeated calculations on array elements much more efficient. It then introduces many of the most common and useful arithmetic ufuncs available in the NumPy package.

universal functions work element-by-element. Let's create a new array scaled by pi

In [ ]:
b = a*np.pi/12.0
print(b)
[[0.         0.26179939 0.52359878 0.78539816]
 [1.04719755 1.30899694 1.57079633 1.83259571]
 [2.0943951  2.35619449 2.61799388 2.87979327]]
In [ ]:
c = np.cos(b)
print(c)
[[ 1.00000000e+00  9.65925826e-01  8.66025404e-01  7.07106781e-01]
 [ 5.00000000e-01  2.58819045e-01  6.12323400e-17 -2.58819045e-01]
 [-5.00000000e-01 -7.07106781e-01 -8.66025404e-01 -9.65925826e-01]]
In [ ]:
d = b + c
In [ ]:
print(d)
[[1.         1.22772521 1.38962418 1.49250494]
 [1.54719755 1.56781598 1.57079633 1.57377667]
 [1.5943951  1.64908771 1.75196847 1.91386744]]
Array Slicing: Accessing Subarrays
Just as we can use square brackets to access individual array elements, we can also use them to access subarrays with the slice notation, marked by the colon (:) character. The NumPy slicing syntax follows that of the standard Python list; to access a slice of an array x, use this:

x[start:stop:step]
If any of these are unspecified, they default to the values start=0, stop=size of dimension, step=1. We'll take a look at accessing sub-arrays in one dimension and in multiple dimensions.

In [ ]:
a = np.arange(9)
a
Out[ ]:
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
Now look at accessing a single element vs. a range (using slicing)

Giving a single (0-based) index just references a single value

In [ ]:
a[3]
Out[ ]:
3
In [ ]:
print(a[2:3])
[2]
In [ ]:
a[2:4]
Out[ ]:
array([2, 3])
In [ ]:
a[:]
Out[ ]:
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
Multidimensional Arrays
Multidimensional arrays are stored in a contiguous space in memory -- this means that the columns / rows need to be unraveled (flattened) so that it can be thought of as a single one-dimensional array. Different programming languages do this via different conventions:

Storage order:

Python/C use row-major storage: rows are stored one after the other
Fortran/matlab use column-major storage: columns are stored one after another
The ordering matters when

passing arrays between languages (we'll talk about this later this semester)
looping over arrays -- you want to access elements that are next to one-another in memory

e.g, in Fortran:

double precision :: A(M,N)
do j = 1, N
 do i = 1, M
    A(i,j) = …
 enddo
enddo
in C

double A[M][N];
for (i = 0; i < M; i++) {
 for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    A[i][j] = …
 }
}  
In python, using NumPy, we'll try to avoid explicit loops over elements as much as possible

Let's look at multidimensional arrays:

In [ ]:
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3,5)
a
Out[ ]:
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])
Notice that the output of a shows the row-major storage. The rows are grouped together in the inner [...]

Giving a single index (0-based) for each dimension just references a single value in the array

In [ ]:
a[1,1]
Out[ ]:
6
Doing slices will access a range of elements. Think of the start and stop in the slice as referencing the left-edge of the slots in the array.

In [ ]:
a[0:2,0:2]
Out[ ]:
array([[0, 1],
       [5, 6]])
Access a specific column

In [ ]:
a[:,1]
Out[ ]:
array([ 1,  6, 11])
Sometimes we want a one-dimensional view into the array -- here we see the memory layout (row-major) more explicitly

In [ ]:
a = a.flatten()
print(a)
[ 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14]
we can also iterate -- this is done over the first axis (rows)

In [ ]:
#print (a)
for r in a:
    print(r)
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3,5)
print(a)
[0 1 2 3 4]
[5 6 7 8 9]
[10 11 12 13 14]
[[ 0  1  2  3  4]
 [ 5  6  7  8  9]
 [10 11 12 13 14]]
or element by element

In [ ]:
for e in a.flat:
    print(e)
0
1
2
3
4

Help on ndarray object:

class ndarray(builtins.object)
 |  ndarray(shape, dtype=float, buffer=None, offset=0,
 |          strides=None, order=None)
 |  
 |  An array object represents a multidimensional, homogeneous array
 |  of fixed-size items.  An associated data-type object describes the
 |  format of each element in the array (its byte-order, how many bytes it
 |  occupies in memory, whether it is an integer, a floating point number,
 |  or something else, etc.)
 |  
 |  Arrays should be constructed using `array`, `zeros` or `empty` (refer
 |  to the See Also section below).  The parameters given here refer to
 |  a low-level method (`ndarray(...)`) for instantiating an array.
 |  
 |  For more information, refer to the `numpy` module and examine the
 |  methods and attributes of an array.
 |  
 |  Parameters
 |  ----------
 |  (for the __new__ method; see Notes below)
 |  
 |  shape : tuple of ints
 |      Shape of created array.
 |  dtype : data-type, optional
 |      Any object that can be interpreted as a numpy data type.
 |  buffer : object exposing buffer interface, optional
 |      Used to fill the array with data.
 |  offset : int, optional
 |      Offset of array data in buffer.
 |  strides : tuple of ints, optional
 |      Strides of data in memory.
 |  order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
 |      Row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order.
 |  
 |  Attributes
 |  ----------
 |  T : ndarray
 |      Transpose of the array.
 |  data : buffer
 |      The array's elements, in memory.
 |  dtype : dtype object
 |      Describes the format of the elements in the array.
 |  flags : dict
 |      Dictionary containing information related to memory use, e.g.,
 |      'C_CONTIGUOUS', 'OWNDATA', 'WRITEABLE', etc.
 |  flat : numpy.flatiter object
 |      Flattened version of the array as an iterator.  The iterator
 |      allows assignments, e.g., ``x.flat = 3`` (See `ndarray.flat` for
 |      assignment examples; TODO).
 |  imag : ndarray
 |      Imaginary part of the array.
 |  real : ndarray
 |      Real part of the array.
 |  size : int
 |      Number of elements in the array.
 |  itemsize : int
 |      The memory use of each array element in bytes.
 |  nbytes : int
 |      The total number of bytes required to store the array data,
 |      i.e., ``itemsize * size``.
 |  ndim : int
 |      The array's number of dimensions.
 |  shape : tuple of ints
 |      Shape of the array.
 |  strides : tuple of ints
 |      The step-size required to move from one element to the next in
 |      memory. For example, a contiguous ``(3, 4)`` array of type
 |      ``int16`` in C-order has strides ``(8, 2)``.  This implies that
 |      to move from element to element in memory requires jumps of 2 bytes.
 |      To move from row-to-row, one needs to jump 8 bytes at a time
 |      (``2 * 4``).
 |  ctypes : ctypes object
 |      Class containing properties of the array needed for interaction
 |      with ctypes.
 |  base : ndarray
 |      If the array is a view into another array, that array is its `base`
 |      (unless that array is also a view).  The `base` array is where the
 |      array data is actually stored.
 |  
 |  See Also
 |  --------
 |  array : Construct an array.
 |  zeros : Create an array, each element of which is zero.
 |  empty : Create an array, but leave its allocated memory unchanged (i.e.,
 |          it contains "garbage").
 |  dtype : Create a data-type.
 |  
 |  Notes
 |  -----
 |  There are two modes of creating an array using ``__new__``:
 |  
 |  1. If `buffer` is None, then only `shape`, `dtype`, and `order`
 |     are used.
 |  2. If `buffer` is an object exposing the buffer interface, then
 |     all keywords are interpreted.
 |  
 |  No ``__init__`` method is needed because the array is fully initialized
 |  after the ``__new__`` method.
 |  
 |  Examples
 |  --------
 |  These examples illustrate the low-level `ndarray` constructor.  Refer
 |  to the `See Also` section above for easier ways of constructing an
 |  ndarray.
 |  
 |  First mode, `buffer` is None:
 |  
 |  >>> np.ndarray(shape=(2,2), dtype=float, order='F')
 |  array([[ -1.13698227e+002,   4.25087011e-303],
 |         [  2.88528414e-306,   3.27025015e-309]])         #random
 |  
 |  Second mode:
 |  
 |  >>> np.ndarray((2,), buffer=np.array([1,2,3]),
 |  ...            offset=np.int_().itemsize,
 |  ...            dtype=int) # offset = 1*itemsize, i.e. skip first element

 |  astype(...)
 |      a.astype(dtype, order='K', casting='unsafe', subok=True, copy=True)
 |      
 |      Copy of the array, cast to a specified type.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      dtype : str or dtype
 |          Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.
 |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
 |          Controls the memory layout order of the result.
 |          'C' means C order, 'F' means Fortran order, 'A'
 |          means 'F' order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous,
 |          'C' order otherwise, and 'K' means as close to the
 |          order the array elements appear in memory as possible.
 |          Default is 'K'.
 |      casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
 |          Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to 'unsafe'
 |          for backwards compatibility.
 |      
 |            * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
 |            * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
 |            * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
 |            * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
 |              like float64 to float32, are allowed.
 |            * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
 |      subok : bool, optional
 |          If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through (default), otherwise
 |          the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array.
 |      copy : bool, optional
 |          By default, astype always returns a newly allocated array. If this
 |          is set to false, and the `dtype`, `order`, and `subok`
 |          requirements are satisfied, the input array is returned instead
 |          of a copy.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      arr_t : ndarray
 |          Unless `copy` is False and the other conditions for returning the input
 |          array are satisfied (see description for `copy` input parameter), `arr_t`
 |          is a new array of the same shape as the input array, with dtype, order
 |          given by `dtype`, `order`.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Starting in NumPy 1.9, astype method now returns an error if the string
 |      dtype to cast to is not long enough in 'safe' casting mode to hold the max
 |      value of integer/float array that is being casted. Previously the casting
 |      was allowed even if the result was truncated.
 |      
 |      Raises
 |      ------
 |      ComplexWarning
 |          When casting from complex to float or int. To avoid this,
 |          one should use ``a.real.astype(t)``.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 2.5])
 |      >>> x
 |      array([ 1. ,  2. ,  2.5])
 |      
 |      >>> x.astype(int)
 |      array([1, 2, 2])
 |  
 |  byteswap(...)
 |      a.byteswap(inplace=False)
 |      
 |      Swap the bytes of the array elements
 |      
 |      Toggle between low-endian and big-endian data representation by
 |      returning a byteswapped array, optionally swapped in-place.
 |      
 |      Parameters

 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      out : ndarray

 |      Parameters
 |      ----------

 |  
 |  dumps(...)
 |      a.dumps()
 |      
 |      Returns the pickle of the array as a string.

 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> a = np.array([1, 2])

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional

 |          'F' means to flatten in column-major (Fortran-
 |          style) order. 'A' means to flatten in column-major
 |          order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory,
 |          row-major order otherwise. 'K' means to flatten
 |          `a` in the order the elements occur in memory.
 |          The default is 'C'.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      y : ndarray
 |          A copy of the input array, flattened to one dimension.
 |      
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      ravel : Return a flattened array.
 |      flat : A 1-D flat iterator over the array.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> a = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
 |      >>> a.flatten()
 |      array([1, 2, 3, 4])
 |      >>> a.flatten('F')
 |      array([1, 3, 2, 4])
 |  
 |  getfield(...)
 |      a.getfield(dtype, offset=0)
 |      
 |      Returns a field of the given array as a certain type.
 |      
 |      A field is a view of the array data with a given data-type. The values in
 |      the view are determined by the given type and the offset into the current
 |      array in bytes. The offset needs to be such that the view dtype fits in the
 |      array dtype; for example an array of dtype complex128 has 16-byte elements.
 |      If taking a view with a 32-bit integer (4 bytes), the offset needs to be
 |      between 0 and 12 bytes.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      dtype : str or dtype
 |          The data type of the view. The dtype size of the view can not be larger
 |          than that of the array itself.
 |      offset : int
 |          Number of bytes to skip before beginning the element view.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.diag([1.+1.j]*2)
 |      >>> x[1, 1] = 2 + 4.j
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[ 1.+1.j,  0.+0.j],
 |             [ 0.+0.j,  2.+4.j]])
 |      >>> x.getfield(np.float64)
 |      array([[ 1.,  0.],
 |             [ 0.,  2.]])
 |      
 |      By choosing an offset of 8 bytes we can select the complex part of the
 |      array for our view:
 |      
 |      >>> x.getfield(np.float64, offset=8)
 |      array([[ 1.,  0.],
 |         [ 0.,  4.]])
 |  
 |  item(...)
 |      a.item(*args)
 |      
 |      Copy an element of an array to a standard Python scalar and return it.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      \*args : Arguments (variable number and type)
 |      
 |          * none: in this case, the method only works for arrays
 |            with one element (`a.size == 1`), which element is
 |            copied into a standard Python scalar object and returned.
 |      
 |          * int_type: this argument is interpreted as a flat index into
 |            the array, specifying which element to copy and return.
 |      
 |          * tuple of int_types: functions as does a single int_type argument,
 |            except that the argument is interpreted as an nd-index into the
 |            array.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      z : Standard Python scalar object
 |          A copy of the specified element of the array as a suitable
 |          Python scalar
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      When the data type of `a` is longdouble or clongdouble, item() returns
 |      a scalar array object because there is no available Python scalar that
 |      would not lose information. Void arrays return a buffer object for item(),
 |      unless fields are defined, in which case a tuple is returned.
 |      
 |      `item` is very similar to a[args], except, instead of an array scalar,
 |      a standard Python scalar is returned. This can be useful for speeding up
 |      access to elements of the array and doing arithmetic on elements of the
 |      array using Python's optimized math.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[3, 1, 7],
 |             [2, 8, 3],
 |             [8, 5, 3]])
 |      >>> x.item(3)
 |      2
 |      >>> x.item(7)
 |      5
 |      >>> x.item((0, 1))
 |      1
 |      >>> x.item((2, 2))
 |      3
 |  
 |  itemset(...)
 |      a.itemset(*args)
 |      
 |      Insert scalar into an array (scalar is cast to array's dtype, if possible)
 |      
 |      There must be at least 1 argument, and define the last argument
 |      as *item*.  Then, ``a.itemset(*args)`` is equivalent to but faster
 |      than ``a[args] = item``.  The item should be a scalar value and `args`
 |      must select a single item in the array `a`.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      \*args : Arguments
 |          If one argument: a scalar, only used in case `a` is of size 1.
 |          If two arguments: the last argument is the value to be set
 |          and must be a scalar, the first argument specifies a single array
 |          element location. It is either an int or a tuple.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Compared to indexing syntax, `itemset` provides some speed increase
 |      for placing a scalar into a particular location in an `ndarray`,
 |      if you must do this.  However, generally this is discouraged:
 |      among other problems, it complicates the appearance of the code.
 |      Also, when using `itemset` (and `item`) inside a loop, be sure
 |      to assign the methods to a local variable to avoid the attribute
 |      look-up at each loop iteration.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
 |      >>> x

 |  newbyteorder(...)
 |      arr.newbyteorder(new_order='S')
 |      
 |      Return the array with the same data viewed with a different byte order.
 |      
 |      Equivalent to::
 |      
 |          arr.view(arr.dtype.newbytorder(new_order))
 |      
 |      Changes are also made in all fields and sub-arrays of the array data
 |      type.
 |      
 |      
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      new_order : string, optional
 |          Byte order to force; a value from the byte order specifications
 |          below. `new_order` codes can be any of:
 |      
 |          * 'S' - swap dtype from current to opposite endian
 |          * {'<', 'L'} - little endian
 |          * {'>', 'B'} - big endian
 |          * {'=', 'N'} - native order
 |          * {'|', 'I'} - ignore (no change to byte order)
 |      
 |          The default value ('S') results in swapping the current
 |          byte order. The code does a case-insensitive check on the first
 |          letter of `new_order` for the alternatives above.  For example,
 |          any of 'B' or 'b' or 'biggish' are valid to specify big-endian.
 |      
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      new_arr : array
 |          New array object with the dtype reflecting given change to the
 |          byte order.
 |  
 |  nonzero(...)
 |      a.nonzero()
 |      
 |      Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.

 |  
 |  partition(...)
 |      a.partition(kth, axis=-1, kind='introselect', order=None)
 |      
 |      Rearranges the elements in the array in such a way that the value of the
 |      element in kth position is in the position it would be in a sorted array.
 |      All elements smaller than the kth element are moved before this element and
 |      all equal or greater are moved behind it. The ordering of the elements in
 |      the two partitions is undefined.
 |      
 |      .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      kth : int or sequence of ints
 |          Element index to partition by. The kth element value will be in its
 |          final sorted position and all smaller elements will be moved before it
 |          and all equal or greater elements behind it.
 |          The order of all elements in the partitions is undefined.
 |          If provided with a sequence of kth it will partition all elements
 |          indexed by kth of them into their sorted position at once.
 |      axis : int, optional
 |          Axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means sort along the
 |          last axis.
 |      kind : {'introselect'}, optional
 |          Selection algorithm. Default is 'introselect'.
 |      order : str or list of str, optional
 |          When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
 |          which fields to compare first, second, etc. A single field can
 |          be specified as a string, and not all fields need to be specified,
 |          but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
 |          they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

 |      Refer to `numpy.reshape` for full documentation.
 |      
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.reshape : equivalent function
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Unlike the free function `numpy.reshape`, this method on `ndarray` allows
 |      the elements of the shape parameter to be passed in as separate arguments.
 |      For example, ``a.reshape(10, 11)`` is equivalent to
 |      ``a.reshape((10, 11))``.
 |  
 |  resize(...)
 |      a.resize(new_shape, refcheck=True)
 |      
 |      Change shape and size of array in-place.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      new_shape : tuple of ints, or `n` ints
 |          Shape of resized array.
 |      refcheck : bool, optional
 |          If False, reference count will not be checked. Default is True.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |      
 |      Raises
 |      ------
 |      ValueError
 |          If `a` does not own its own data or references or views to it exist,
 |          and the data memory must be changed.
 |          PyPy only: will always raise if the data memory must be changed, since
 |          there is no reliable way to determine if references or views to it
 |          exist.
 |      
 |      SystemError
 |          If the `order` keyword argument is specified. This behaviour is a
 |          bug in NumPy.
 |      
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      resize : Return a new array with the specified shape.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      This reallocates space for the data area if necessary.
 |      
 |      Only contiguous arrays (data elements consecutive in memory) can be
 |      resized.
 |      
 |      The purpose of the reference count check is to make sure you
 |      do not use this array as a buffer for another Python object and then
 |      reallocate the memory. However, reference counts can increase in
 |      other ways so if you are sure that you have not shared the memory
 |      for this array with another Python object, then you may safely set
 |      `refcheck` to False.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      Shrinking an array: array is flattened (in the order that the data are
 |      stored in memory), resized, and reshaped:
 |      
 |      >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='C')
 |      >>> a.resize((2, 1))
 |      >>> a
 |      array([[0],
 |             [1]])
 |      
 |      >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='F')
 |      >>> a.resize((2, 1))
 |      >>> a
 |      array([[0],
 |             [2]])
 |      
 |      Enlarging an array: as above, but missing entries are filled with zeros:
 |      
 |      >>> b = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
 |      >>> b.resize(2, 3) # new_shape parameter doesn't have to be a tuple
 |      >>> b
 |      array([[0, 1, 2],
 |             [3, 0, 0]])
 |      
 |      Referencing an array prevents resizing...
 |      
 |      >>> c = a
 |      >>> a.resize((1, 1))
 |      Traceback (most recent call last):
 |      ...
 |      ValueError: cannot resize an array that has been referenced ...
 |      
 |      Unless `refcheck` is False:
 |      
 |      >>> a.resize((1, 1), refcheck=False)
 |      >>> a
 |      array([[0]])
 |      >>> c
 |      array([[0]])
 |  
 |  round(...)

 |      array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.],
 |             [ 0.,  1.,  0.],

 |  
 |  setflags(...)
 |      a.setflags(write=None, align=None, uic=None)
 |      
 |      Set array flags WRITEABLE, ALIGNED, (WRITEBACKIFCOPY and UPDATEIFCOPY),
 |      respectively.
 |      
 |      These Boolean-valued flags affect how numpy interprets the memory
 |      area used by `a` (see Notes below). The ALIGNED flag can only
 |      be set to True if the data is actually aligned according to the type.
 |      The WRITEBACKIFCOPY and (deprecated) UPDATEIFCOPY flags can never be set
 |      to True. The flag WRITEABLE can only be set to True if the array owns its
 |      own memory, or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
 |      interface, or is a string. (The exception for string is made so that
 |      unpickling can be done without copying memory.)
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      write : bool, optional
 |          Describes whether or not `a` can be written to.
 |      align : bool, optional
 |          Describes whether or not `a` is aligned properly for its type.
 |      uic : bool, optional
 |          Describes whether or not `a` is a copy of another "base" array.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Array flags provide information about how the memory area used
 |      for the array is to be interpreted. There are 7 Boolean flags
 |      in use, only four of which can be changed by the user:
 |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY, UPDATEIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED.
 |      
 |      WRITEABLE (W) the data area can be written to;
 |      
 |      ALIGNED (A) the data and strides are aligned appropriately for the hardware
 |      (as determined by the compiler);
 |      
 |      UPDATEIFCOPY (U) (deprecated), replaced by WRITEBACKIFCOPY;
 |      
 |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X) this array is a copy of some other array (referenced
 |      by .base). When the C-API function PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy is
 |      called, the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.
 |      
 |      All flags can be accessed using the single (upper case) letter as well
 |      as the full name.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> y

 |      order : str or list of str, optional
 |          When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
 |          which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
 |          be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
 |          but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
 |          they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

 |  tobytes(...)
 |      a.tobytes(order='C')
 |      
 |      Construct Python bytes containing the raw data bytes in the array.
 |      
 |      Constructs Python bytes showing a copy of the raw contents of
 |      data memory. The bytes object can be produced in either 'C' or 'Fortran',
 |      or 'Any' order (the default is 'C'-order). 'Any' order means C-order
 |      unless the F_CONTIGUOUS flag in the array is set, in which case it
 |      means 'Fortran' order.
 |      
 |      .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      order : {'C', 'F', None}, optional
 |          Order of the data for multidimensional arrays:
 |          C, Fortran, or the same as for the original array.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      s : bytes
 |          Python bytes exhibiting a copy of `a`'s raw data.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
 |      >>> x.tobytes()
 |      b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00'
 |      >>> x.tobytes('C') == x.tobytes()
 |      True
 |      >>> x.tobytes('F')
 |      b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00'
 |  
 |  tofile(...)
 |      a.tofile(fid, sep="", format="%s")
 |      
 |      Write array to a file as text or binary (default).
 |      
 |      Data is always written in 'C' order, independent of the order of `a`.
 |      The data produced by this method can be recovered using the function
 |      fromfile().
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      fid : file or str
 |          An open file object, or a string containing a filename.
 |      sep : str
 |          Separator between array items for text output.
 |          If "" (empty), a binary file is written, equivalent to
 |          ``file.write(a.tobytes())``.
 |      format : str
 |          Format string for text file output.
 |          Each entry in the array is formatted to text by first converting
 |          it to the closest Python type, and then using "format" % item.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      This is a convenience function for quick storage of array data.
 |      Information on endianness and precision is lost, so this method is not a
 |      good choice for files intended to archive data or transport data between
 |      machines with different endianness. Some of these problems can be overcome
 |      by outputting the data as text files, at the expense of speed and file
 |      size.
 |      
 |      When fid is a file object, array contents are directly written to the
 |      file, bypassing the file object's ``write`` method. As a result, tofile
 |      cannot be used with files objects supporting compression (e.g., GzipFile)
 |      or file-like objects that do not support ``fileno()`` (e.g., BytesIO).
 |  
 |  tolist(...)
 |      a.tolist()
 |      
 |      Return the array as a (possibly nested) list.
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the array data as a (nested) Python list.
 |      Data items are converted to the nearest compatible Python type.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      none
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      y : list
 |          The possibly nested list of array elements.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      The array may be recreated, ``a = np.array(a.tolist())``.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> a = np.array([1, 2])
 |      >>> a.tolist()
 |      [1, 2]
 |      >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
 |      >>> list(a)
 |      [array([1, 2]), array([3, 4])]
 |      >>> a.tolist()
 |      [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
 |  
 |  tostring(...)
 |      a.tostring(order='C')
 |      
 |      Construct Python bytes containing the raw data bytes in the array.
 |      
 |      Constructs Python bytes showing a copy of the raw contents of
 |      data memory. The bytes object can be produced in either 'C' or 'Fortran',
 |      or 'Any' order (the default is 'C'-order). 'Any' order means C-order
 |      unless the F_CONTIGUOUS flag in the array is set, in which case it
 |      means 'Fortran' order.
 |      
 |      This function is a compatibility alias for tobytes. Despite its name it returns bytes not strings.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      order : {'C', 'F', None}, optional
 |          Order of the data for multidimensional arrays:
 |          C, Fortran, or the same as for the original array.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      s : bytes
 |          Python bytes exhibiting a copy of `a`'s raw data.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
 |      >>> x.tobytes()
 |      b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00'
 |      >>> x.tobytes('C') == x.tobytes()
 |      True
 |      >>> x.tobytes('F')
 |      b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00'
 |  
 |  trace(...)
 |      a.trace(offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1, dtype=None, out=None)
 |      
 |      Return the sum along diagonals of the array.
 |      
 |      Refer to `numpy.trace` for full documentation.
 |      
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.trace : equivalent function
 |  
 |  transpose(...)
 |      a.transpose(*axes)
 |      
 |      Returns a view of the array with axes transposed.
 |      
 |      For a 1-D array, this has no effect. (To change between column and
 |      row vectors, first cast the 1-D array into a matrix object.)
 |      For a 2-D array, this is the usual matrix transpose.
 |      For an n-D array, if axes are given, their order indicates how the
 |      axes are permuted (see Examples). If axes are not provided and
 |      ``a.shape = (i[0], i[1], ... i[n-2], i[n-1])``, then
 |      ``a.transpose().shape = (i[n-1], i[n-2], ... i[1], i[0])``.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      axes : None, tuple of ints, or `n` ints
 |      
 |       * None or no argument: reverses the order of the axes.
 |      
 |       * tuple of ints: `i` in the `j`-th place in the tuple means `a`'s
 |         `i`-th axis becomes `a.transpose()`'s `j`-th axis.
 |      
 |       * `n` ints: same as an n-tuple of the same ints (this form is
 |         intended simply as a "convenience" alternative to the tuple form)
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      out : ndarray
 |          View of `a`, with axes suitably permuted.
 |      
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      ndarray.T : Array property returning the array transposed.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
 |      >>> a
 |      array([[1, 2],
 |             [3, 4]])
 |      >>> a.transpose()
 |      array([[1, 3],
 |             [2, 4]])
 |      >>> a.transpose((1, 0))
 |      array([[1, 3],
 |             [2, 4]])
 |      >>> a.transpose(1, 0)
 |      array([[1, 3],
 |             [2, 4]])
 |  
 |  var(...)
 |      a.var(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, ddof=0, keepdims=False)
 |      
 |      Returns the variance of the array elements, along given axis.
 |      
 |      Refer to `numpy.var` for full documentation.
 |      
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.var : equivalent function
 |  
 |  view(...)
 |      a.view(dtype=None, type=None)
 |      
 |      New view of array with the same data.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      dtype : data-type or ndarray sub-class, optional
 |          Data-type descriptor of the returned view, e.g., float32 or int16. The
 |          default, None, results in the view having the same data-type as `a`.
 |          This argument can also be specified as an ndarray sub-class, which
 |          then specifies the type of the returned object (this is equivalent to
 |          setting the ``type`` parameter).
 |      type : Python type, optional
 |          Type of the returned view, e.g., ndarray or matrix.  Again, the
 |          default None results in type preservation.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      ``a.view()`` is used two different ways:
 |      
 |      ``a.view(some_dtype)`` or ``a.view(dtype=some_dtype)`` constructs a view
 |      of the array's memory with a different data-type.  This can cause a
 |      reinterpretation of the bytes of memory.
 |      
 |      ``a.view(ndarray_subclass)`` or ``a.view(type=ndarray_subclass)`` just
 |      returns an instance of `ndarray_subclass` that looks at the same array
 |      (same shape, dtype, etc.)  This does not cause a reinterpretation of the
 |      memory.
 |      
 |      For ``a.view(some_dtype)``, if ``some_dtype`` has a different number of
 |      bytes per entry than the previous dtype (for example, converting a
 |      regular array to a structured array), then the behavior of the view
 |      cannot be predicted just from the superficial appearance of ``a`` (shown
 |      by ``print(a)``). It also depends on exactly how ``a`` is stored in
 |      memory. Therefore if ``a`` is C-ordered versus fortran-ordered, versus
 |      defined as a slice or transpose, etc., the view may give different
 |      results.
 |      
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([(1, 2)], dtype=[('a', np.int8), ('b', np.int8)])
 |      
 |      Viewing array data using a different type and dtype:
 |      
 |      >>> y = x.view(dtype=np.int16, type=np.matrix)
 |      >>> y
 |      matrix([[513]], dtype=int16)
 |      >>> print(type(y))
 |      <class 'numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix.matrix'>
 |      
 |      Creating a view on a structured array so it can be used in calculations
 |      
 |      >>> x = np.array([(1, 2),(3,4)], dtype=[('a', np.int8), ('b', np.int8)])
 |      >>> xv = x.view(dtype=np.int8).reshape(-1,2)
 |      >>> xv
 |      array([[1, 2],
 |             [3, 4]], dtype=int8)
 |      >>> xv.mean(0)
 |      array([ 2.,  3.])
 |      
 |      Making changes to the view changes the underlying array
 |      
 |      >>> xv[0,1] = 20
 |      >>> print(x)
 |      [(1, 20) (3, 4)]
 |      
 |      Using a view to convert an array to a recarray:
 |      
 |      >>> z = x.view(np.recarray)
 |      >>> z.a
 |      array([1], dtype=int8)
 |      
 |      Views share data:
 |      
 |      >>> x[0] = (9, 10)
 |      >>> z[0]
 |      (9, 10)
 |      
 |      Views that change the dtype size (bytes per entry) should normally be
 |      avoided on arrays defined by slices, transposes, fortran-ordering, etc.:
 |      
 |      >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], dtype=np.int16)
 |      >>> y = x[:, 0:2]
 |      >>> y
 |      array([[1, 2],
 |             [4, 5]], dtype=int16)
 |      >>> y.view(dtype=[('width', np.int16), ('length', np.int16)])
 |      Traceback (most recent call last):
 |        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
 |      ValueError: new type not compatible with array.
 |      >>> z = y.copy()
 |      >>> z.view(dtype=[('width', np.int16), ('length', np.int16)])
 |      array([[(1, 2)],
 |             [(4, 5)]], dtype=[('width', '<i2'), ('length', '<i2')])

 |  base
 |      Base object if memory is from some other object.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      The base of an array that owns its memory is None:
 |      
 |      >>> x = np.array([1,2,3,4])
 |      >>> x.base is None
 |      True
 |      
 |      Slicing creates a view, whose memory is shared with x:
 |      
 |      >>> y = x[2:]
 |      >>> y.base is x
 |      True
 |  
 |  ctypes
 |      An object to simplify the interaction of the array with the ctypes
 |      module.
 |      
 |      This attribute creates an object that makes it easier to use arrays
 |      when calling shared libraries with the ctypes module. The returned
 |      object has, among others, data, shape, and strides attributes (see
 |      Notes below) which themselves return ctypes objects that can be used
 |      as arguments to a shared library.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      None
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      c : Python object
 |          Possessing attributes data, shape, strides, etc.
 |      
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.ctypeslib
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Below are the public attributes of this object which were documented
 |      in "Guide to NumPy" (we have omitted undocumented public attributes,
 |      as well as documented private attributes):
 |      
 |      .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.data
 |      
 |      .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.shape
 |      
 |      .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.strides
 |      
 |      .. automethod:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.data_as
 |      
 |      .. automethod:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.shape_as
 |      
 |      .. automethod:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.strides_as
 |      
 |      If the ctypes module is not available, then the ctypes attribute
 |      of array objects still returns something useful, but ctypes objects
 |      are not returned and errors may be raised instead. In particular,
 |      the object will still have the as parameter attribute which will
 |      return an integer equal to the data attribute.
 |      
 |      Examples

 |      >>> import ctypes
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[0, 1],

 |      >>> x.dtype
 |      dtype('int32')
 |      >>> type(x.dtype)
 |      <type 'numpy.dtype'>
 |  
 |  flags
 |      Information about the memory layout of the array.
 |      
 |      Attributes
 |      ----------
 |      C_CONTIGUOUS (C)
 |          The data is in a single, C-style contiguous segment.
 |      F_CONTIGUOUS (F)
 |          The data is in a single, Fortran-style contiguous segment.
 |      OWNDATA (O)
 |          The array owns the memory it uses or borrows it from another object.
 |      WRITEABLE (W)
 |          The data area can be written to.  Setting this to False locks
 |          the data, making it read-only.  A view (slice, etc.) inherits WRITEABLE
 |          from its base array at creation time, but a view of a writeable
 |          array may be subsequently locked while the base array remains writeable.
 |          (The opposite is not true, in that a view of a locked array may not
 |          be made writeable.  However, currently, locking a base object does not
 |          lock any views that already reference it, so under that circumstance it
 |          is possible to alter the contents of a locked array via a previously
 |          created writeable view onto it.)  Attempting to change a non-writeable
 |          array raises a RuntimeError exception.
 |      ALIGNED (A)
 |          The data and all elements are aligned appropriately for the hardware.
 |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X)
 |          This array is a copy of some other array. The C-API function
 |          PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy must be called before deallocating
 |          to the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.
 |      UPDATEIFCOPY (U)
 |          (Deprecated, use WRITEBACKIFCOPY) This array is a copy of some other array.
 |          When this array is
 |          deallocated, the base array will be updated with the contents of
 |          this array.
 |      FNC
 |          F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.
 |      FORC
 |          F_CONTIGUOUS or C_CONTIGUOUS (one-segment test).
 |      BEHAVED (B)
 |          ALIGNED and WRITEABLE.
 |      CARRAY (CA)
 |          BEHAVED and C_CONTIGUOUS.
 |      FARRAY (FA)
 |          BEHAVED and F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      The `flags` object can be accessed dictionary-like (as in ``a.flags['WRITEABLE']``),
 |      or by using lowercased attribute names (as in ``a.flags.writeable``). Short flag
 |      names are only supported in dictionary access.
 |      
 |      Only the WRITEBACKIFCOPY, UPDATEIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED flags can be
 |      changed by the user, via direct assignment to the attribute or dictionary
 |      entry, or by calling `ndarray.setflags`.
 |      
 |      The array flags cannot be set arbitrarily:
 |      
 |      - UPDATEIFCOPY can only be set ``False``.
 |      - WRITEBACKIFCOPY can only be set ``False``.
 |      - ALIGNED can only be set ``True`` if the data is truly aligned.
 |      - WRITEABLE can only be set ``True`` if the array owns its own memory
 |        or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
 |        interface or is a string.
 |      
 |      Arrays can be both C-style and Fortran-style contiguous simultaneously.
 |      This is clear for 1-dimensional arrays, but can also be true for higher
 |      dimensional arrays.
 |      
 |      Even for contiguous arrays a stride for a given dimension
 |      ``arr.strides[dim]`` may be *arbitrary* if ``arr.shape[dim] == 1``
 |      or the array has no elements.
 |      It does *not* generally hold that ``self.strides[-1] == self.itemsize``
 |      for C-style contiguous arrays or ``self.strides[0] == self.itemsize`` for
 |      Fortran-style contiguous arrays is true.
 |  
 |  flat
 |      A 1-D iterator over the array.
 |      
 |      This is a `numpy.flatiter` instance, which acts similarly to, but is not
 |      a subclass of, Python's built-in iterator object.

 |  
 |  imag
 |      The imaginary part of the array.

 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.sqrt([1+0j, 0+1j])
 |      >>> x.imag

 |  shape
 |      Tuple of array dimensions.
 |      
 |      The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of an array,
 |      but may also be used to reshape the array in-place by assigning a tuple of
 |      array dimensions to it.  As with `numpy.reshape`, one of the new shape
 |      dimensions can be -1, in which case its value is inferred from the size of
 |      the array and the remaining dimensions. Reshaping an array in-place will
 |      fail if a copy is required.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
 |      >>> x.shape
 |      (4,)
 |      >>> y = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))

 |  size
 |      Number of elements in the array.
 |      
 |      Equal to ``np.prod(a.shape)``, i.e., the product of the array's
 |      dimensions.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      `a.size` returns a standard arbitrary precision Python integer. This
 |      may not be the case with other methods of obtaining the same value
 |      (like the suggested ``np.prod(a.shape)``, which returns an instance
 |      of ``np.int_``), and may be relevant if the value is used further in
 |      calculations that may overflow a fixed size integer type.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.zeros((3, 5, 2), dtype=np.complex128)
 |      >>> x.size
 |      30
 |      >>> np.prod(x.shape)
 |      30
 |  
 |  strides
 |      Tuple of bytes to step in each dimension when traversing an array.
 |      
 |      The byte offset of element ``(i[0], i[1], ..., i[n])`` in an array `a`
 |      is::
 |      
 |          offset = sum(np.array(i) * a.strides)
 |      
 |      A more detailed explanation of strides can be found in the
 |      "ndarray.rst" file in the NumPy reference guide.
 |      
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Imagine an array of 32-bit integers (each 4 bytes)::
 |      
 |        x = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
 |                      [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]], dtype=np.int32)
 |      
 |      This array is stored in memory as 40 bytes, one after the other
 |      (known as a contiguous block of memory).  The strides of an array tell
 |      us how many bytes we have to skip in memory to move to the next position
 |      along a certain axis.  For example, we have to skip 4 bytes (1 value) to
 |      move to the next column, but 20 bytes (5 values) to get to the same
 |      position in the next row.  As such, the strides for the array `x` will be
 |      ``(20, 4)``.

Copying Arrays
simply using "=" does not make a copy, but much like with lists, you will just have multiple names pointing to the same ndarray object

Therefore, we need to understand if two arrays, A and B point to:

the same array, including shape and data/memory space
the same data/memory space, but perhaps different shapes (a view)
a separate cpy of the data (i.e. stored completely separately in memory)
All of these are possible:

B = A

this is assignment. No copy is made. A and B point to the same data in memory and share the same shape, etc. They are just two different labels for the same object in memory

B = A[:]

this is a view or shallow copy. The shape info for A and B are stored independently, but both point to the same memory location for data

B = A.copy()

this is a deep copy. A completely separate object will be created in memory, with a completely separate location in memory.

Let's look at examples

In [ ]:
a = np.arange(10)
print(a)
[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
Here is assignment -- we can just use the is operator to test for equality

In [ ]:
b = a
b is a
Out[ ]:
True
Since b and a are the same, changes to the shape of one are reflected in the other -- no copy is made.

In [ ]:
b.shape = (2, 5)
print(b)
a.shape
[[0 1 2 3 4]
 [5 6 7 8 9]]
Out[ ]:
(2, 5)
In [ ]:
b is a
Out[ ]:
True
In [ ]:
print(a)
[[0 1 2 3 4]
 [5 6 7 8 9]]
a shallow copy creates a new view into the array -- the data is the same, but the array properties can be different

In [ ]:
a = np.arange(12)
c = a[:]
a.shape = (3,4)

print(a)
print(c)
[[ 0  1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6  7]
 [ 8  9 10 11]]
[ 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11]
since the underlying data is the same memory, changing an element of one is reflected in the other

In [ ]:
c[1] = -1
print(a)
print(c)
[[ 0 -1  2  3]
 [ 4  5  6  7]
 [ 8  9 10 11]]
[ 0 -1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11]
Even slices into an array are just views, still pointing to the same memory

In [ ]:
d = c[3:8]
print(d)
[3 4 5 6 7]
In [ ]:
d[:] = 0
In [ ]:
print(a)
print(c)
print(d)
[[ 0 -1  2  0]
 [ 0  0  0  0]
 [ 8  9 10 11]]
[ 0 -1  2  0  0  0  0  0  8  9 10 11]
[0 0 0 0 0]
There are lots of ways to inquire if two arrays are the same, views, own their own data, etc

In [ ]:
print(c is a)
print(c.base is a)
print(c.flags.owndata)
print(a.flags.owndata)
False
True
False
True
to make a copy of the data of the array that you can deal with independently of the original, you need a deep copy

In [ ]:
d = a.copy()
d[:,:] = 0.0

print(a)
print(d)
[[ 0 -1  2  0]
 [ 0  0  0  0]
 [ 8  9 10 11]]
[[0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0]]
Boolean Indexing
There are lots of fun ways to index arrays to access only those elements that meet a certain condition

In [ ]:
a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
a
Out[ ]:
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
       [ 8,  9, 10, 11]])
Here we set all the elements in the array that are > 4 to zero

In [ ]:
a[a > 4] = 0
a
Out[ ]:
array([[0, 1, 2, 3],
       [4, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0]])
and now, all the zeros to -1

In [ ]:
a[a == 0] = -1
a
Out[ ]:
array([[-1,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 4, -1, -1, -1],
       [-1, -1, -1, -1]])
In [ ]:
a == -1
Out[ ]:
array([[ True, False, False, False],
       [False,  True,  True,  True],
       [ True,  True,  True,  True]])
if we have 2 tests, we need to use logical_and() or logical_or()

In [ ]:
a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
a[np.logical_and(a > 3, a <= 9)] = 0.0
a
Out[ ]:
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
       [ 0,  0,  0,  0],
       [ 0,  0, 10, 11]])
Our test that we index the array with returns a boolean array of the same shape:

In [ ]:
a > 4
Out[ ]:
array([[False, False, False, False],
       [False, False, False, False],
       [False, False,  True,  True]])
Avoiding Loops
Python's default implementation (known as CPython) does some operations very slowly. This is in part due to the dynamic, interpreted nature of the language: the fact that types are flexible, so that sequences of operations cannot be compiled down to efficient machine code as in languages like C and Fortran. Recently there have been various attempts to address this weakness: well-known examples are the PyPy project, a just-in-time compiled implementation of Python; the Cython project, which converts Python code to compilable C code; and the Numba project, which converts snippets of Python code to fast LLVM bytecode. Each of these has its strengths and weaknesses, but it is safe to say that none of the three approaches has yet surpassed the reach and popularity of the standard CPython engine.

The relative sluggishness of Python generally manifests itself in situations where many small operations are being repeated – for instance looping over arrays to operate on each element.

In general, you want to avoid loops over elements on an array.

Here, let's create 1-d x and y coordinates and then try to fill some larger array

In [ ]:
M = 32
N = 64
xmin = ymin = 0.0
xmax = ymax = 1.0

x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, M, endpoint=False)
y = np.linspace(ymin, ymax, N, endpoint=False)

print(x.shape)
print(y.shape)
y
(32,)
(64,)
Out[ ]:

       0.75    , 0.765625, 0.78125 , 0.796875, 0.8125  , 0.828125,
       0.84375 , 0.859375, 0.875   , 0.890625, 0.90625 , 0.921875,
       0.9375  , 0.953125, 0.96875 , 0.984375])
we'll time out code

In [ ]:
import time
import numpy as np
M = 32
N = 64

x = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, M, endpoint=False)
y = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, N, endpoint=False)
In [ ]:
t0 = time.time()

g = np.zeros((M, N))

for i in range(M):
    for j in range(N):
        g[i,j] = np.sin(2.0*np.pi*x[i]*y[j])
        
t1 = time.time()
print("time elapsed: {} s".format(t1-t0))
time elapsed: 0.004773855209350586 s
Now let's instead do this using all array syntax. First will extend our 1-d coordinate arrays to be 2-d

In [ ]:
x2d, y2d = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing="ij")

print(x2d[:,0])
print(x2d[0,:])

NumPy Standard Data Types
NumPy arrays contain values of a single type, so it is important to have detailed knowledge of those types and their limitations. Because NumPy is built in C, the types will be familiar to users of C, Fortran, and other related languages.

The standard NumPy data types are listed in the following table. Note that when constructing an array, they can be specified using a string:

np.zeros(10, dtype='int16')
Or using the associated NumPy object:

np.zeros(10, dtype=np.int16)
Data type	Description
bool_	Boolean (True or False) stored as a byte
int_	Default integer type (same as C long; normally either int64 or int32)
intc	Identical to C int (normally int32 or int64)
intp	Integer used for indexing (same as C ssize_t; normally either int32 or int64)
int8	Byte (-128 to 127)
int16	Integer (-32768 to 32767)
int32	Integer (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64	Integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)
uint8	Unsigned integer (0 to 255)
uint16	Unsigned integer (0 to 65535)
uint32	Unsigned integer (0 to 4294967295)
uint64	Unsigned integer (0 to 18446744073709551615)
float_	Shorthand for float64.
float16	Half precision float: sign bit, 5 bits exponent, 10 bits mantissa
float32	Single precision float: sign bit, 8 bits exponent, 23 bits mantissa
float64	Double precision float: sign bit, 11 bits exponent, 52 bits mantissa
complex_	Shorthand for complex128.
complex64	Complex number, represented by two 32-bit floats
complex128	Complex number, represented by two 64-bit floats
More advanced type specification is possible, such as specifying big or little endian numbers; for more information, refer to the NumPy documentation. NumPy also supports compound data types, which will be covered in Structured Data: NumPy's Structured Arrays.

Array Concatenation and Splitting
All of the preceding routines worked on single arrays. It's also possible to combine multiple arrays into one, and to conversely split a single array into multiple arrays. We'll take a look at those operations here.

Concatenation of arrays
Concatenation, or joining of two arrays in NumPy, is primarily accomplished using the routines np.concatenate, np.vstack, and np.hstack. np.concatenate takes a tuple or list of arrays as its first argument, as we can see here:

In [ ]:
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
y = np.array([4, 3, 2, 1])
np.concatenate([y,x])
Out[ ]:
array([4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4])
You can also concatenate more than two arrays at once:

In [ ]:
z = [9, 4, 6]
print(np.concatenate([x, y, z]))
[1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 9 4 6]
It can also be used for two-dimensional arrays:

In [ ]:
grid = np.array([[10, 20, 30],
                 [40, 50, 60]])
In [ ]:
# concatenate along the first axis
np.concatenate([grid, grid])
Out[ ]:
array([[10, 20, 30],
       [40, 50, 60],
       [10, 20, 30],
       [40, 50, 60]])
In [ ]:
# concatenate along the second axis (zero-indexed)
np.concatenate([grid, grid], axis=1)
Out[ ]:
array([[10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30],
       [40, 50, 60, 40, 50, 60]])
Splitting of arrays
The opposite of concatenation is splitting, which is implemented by the functions np.split, np.hsplit, and np.vsplit. For each of these, we can pass a list of indices giving the split points:

In [ ]:
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3 ,2, 1, 9, 4 ,6]
x1, x2, x3,x4 = np.split(x, [3, 5,8])
print(x1, x2, x3, x4)
[1 2 3] [4 4] [3 2 1] [9 4 6]
Notice that N split-points, leads to N + 1 subarrays. The related functions np.hsplit and np.vsplit are similar:

In [ ]:
grid = np.arange(25).reshape((5, 5))
grid
Out[ ]:
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
       [15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
       [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]])
In [ ]:
left, right = np.hsplit(grid, [2])
print(left)
print(right)
[[ 0  1]
 [ 5  6]
 [10 11]
 [15 16]
 [20 21]]
[[ 2  3  4]
 [ 7  8  9]
 [12 13 14]
 [17 18 19]
 [22 23 24]]
Aggregates
For binary ufuncs, there are some interesting aggregates that can be computed directly from the object. For example, if we'd like to reduce an array with a particular operation, we can use the reduce method of any ufunc. A reduce repeatedly applies a given operation to the elements of an array until only a single result remains.

For example, calling reduce on the add ufunc returns the sum of all elements in the array:

In [ ]:
x = np.arange(1, 9)
print(x)
np.add.reduce(x)
[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
Out[ ]:
36
Similarly, calling reduce on the multiply ufunc results in the product of all array elements:

In [ ]:
np.multiply.reduce(x)
Out[ ]:
40320
If we'd like to store all the intermediate results of the computation, we can instead use accumulate:

In [ ]:
np.add.accumulate(x)
Out[ ]:
array([ 1,  3,  6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36])
In [ ]:
np.multiply.accumulate(x)
Out[ ]:
array([    1,     2,     6,    24,   120,   720,  5040, 40320])
In [ ]:
